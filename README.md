# SmartWeather API

**SmartWeather** is a RESTful API designed for managing IoT weather stations, monitoring environmental metrics, and generating AI-driven weather and pollution predictions.

This system allows to manage groups of devices, track real-time sensor data (Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, PM2.5, PM10), configure automatic alerts, and consume future forecasts generated by external machine learning models. It also features an AI Chat Module, allowing users to interact with their devices and query data using natural language.
