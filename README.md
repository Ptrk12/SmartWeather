# SmartWeather API

**SmartWeather** is a RESTful API designed for managing IoT weather stations, monitoring environmental metrics, and generating AI-driven weather and pollution predictions.

This system allows to manage groups of devices, track real-time sensor data (Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, PM2.5, PM10), configure automatic alerts, and consume future forecasts generated by external machine learning models.
