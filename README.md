# SmartWeather API

**SmartWeather** is a RESTful API designed for managing IoT weather stations, monitoring environmental metrics, and generating AI-driven weather and pollution predictions.

This system allows to manage groups of devices, track real-time sensor data (Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, PM2.5, PM10), configure automatic alerts, and consume future forecasts generated by external machine learning models.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Device Management**: Organize devices into logical groups.
* **Sensor Metrics**: Dynamic configuration of sensors attached to devices (supports various metric types and units).
* **Real-Time Monitoring**: Retrieve historical measurement data with date-range filtering.
* **AI Predictions**: Integrated support for AI forecasting (up to 72 hours) using models like **LSTM, BiLSTM, Attention-LSTM and Random Forest**
* **Smart Alerting**:
    * Define custom threshold rules.
    * **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** support for real-time alert streaming.
    * Historical alert logging.
* **Security**: Role-based JWT Authentication

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Core**: ASP.NET Core Web API 
* **AI Integration**: Python-based Azure Functions (LSTM, Attention LSTM, BiLSTM, Random Forest).
* **Streaming**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time alerts.
